Project Description:
-
Uses a master/slave relationship to find the desire output. 

Given:
-
- frequency = 16MHz 
- (1/(16 * 10^6)) = 62.5 * 10^-9  = 1 cycle 
- Ideal time = 0.542
- number of cycles = (ideal time) / (time for one cycle)
- (0.542)/ (62.5 * 10^-9) = 8672000
- Range of cycles (i.e +_ 40 cycles)

Output:
-
- Cycle: 
- R29 : 
- Count: 
- High int: 
- Low int:
- Print out Blinky code 

TOdo:
-
- Implement data structor 
- implement writing and reading from textfile
  - have it save the data structor to the file 
  - have it remember which line it read last so when the 
  - program ends it knows where to start again.
